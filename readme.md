# Guatapay Modal

Front-end vanilla js component to process Guatapay payment intentions via a modal

Stack: Vanilla JS

## Integration Flow

Ecommerce platforms that wishes to implement Guatapay payments with this frontend must also make use of the Guatapay ecommerce API from their backend.

When an order is being placed in the ecommerce platform, and the payment method chosen by the user is Guatapay, the ecommerce platform backend must take the following actions:

## Client Usage

The client must include the following script in the page where the payment modal will be shown and initialized

```html
<script src="http://guatapay-modal.conexa.ai/dist/bundle.js" charset="utf-8">
```

```js
function createPaymentIntention(currency) {
  // ... calls ecommerce own backend to create a Ã¡yment intetion and returns the data
}

function getQuotation(currency) {
  // ... calls ecommerce own backend to get a quotation and returns the data
}

const cartData = {
  total: 12000,
  currency: 'COP',
};

const modalObject = {
  total: cartData.total,
  currency: cartData.currency,
  onSuccess() {
    console.log('onSuccess');
  },
  onFailure() {
    console.log('onFailure');
  },
  onCancel() {
    console.log('onCancel');
  },
  onQuotation: async (currency) => {
    const quotation = await getQuotation(currency);
    const { crypto, fiat } = quotation;

    return {
      crypto: {
        amount: crypto.amount,
        fee: crypto.fee,
      },
      fiat: {
        amount: fiat.amount,
        fee: fiat.fee,
      },
    };
  },
  onPayment: async (currency) => {
    const paymentIntention = await createPaymentIntention(currency);
    const { qrString, paymentId, crypto, fiat } = paymentIntention;

    return {
      qrString,
      paymentId,
      crypto: {
        amount: crypto.amount,
        fee: crypto.fee,
      },
      fiat: {
        amount: fiat.amount,
        fee: fiat.fee,
      },
    };
  },
};

GuatapaySDK.InitPayment(modalObject);
```
