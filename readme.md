# Guatapay Modal

Front-end vanilla js component to process Guatapay payment intentions via a modal (on desktop) or deeplink (on mobile)

Stack: Vanilla JS

## Integration Flow

Ecommerce platforms that wishes to implement Guatapay payments with this frontend must also make use of the Guatapay ecommerce API from their backend.

When an order is being placed in the ecommerce platform, and the payment method chosen by the user is Guatapay, the ecommerce platform backend must take the folowing actions:

- Obtain an Access Token from the Guatapay API by passing its credentials (username and password) to the `/tokens` endpoint.
- Create a `payment-intention` in the Guatapay API by passing the order details to the `POST /payment-intention` endpoint.
- Pass the `qr`, `id` and `deeplink` fields obtained from the created payment-intention back to its frontend, which must implement the code under the "Client Usage" section to present the user with the payment flow.
- After the payment has been procesed (status is accepted, rejected, etc) Guatapay will send a notification to the ecommerce platform backend, which must in turn send a request back to the Guatapay API in the `GET /payment-intention/{payment-intention-id}` endpoint to verify the status of the transaction and upate its database accordingly.

## Client Usage

```html
<script src="https://guatapay-modal.conexa.ai/dist/bundle.js" charset="utf-8">
```

```js
function createPaymentIntention() {
  // ... calls ecommerce own backend to create a Ã¡yment intetion and returns the data
}
var paymentIntention = createPaymentIntention();
var options = {
  qrString: paymentIntention.qr,
  checkoutId: paymentIntention.id,
  deeplink: {
    url: "...",
    callbackURL: "...",
    callbackURLSuccess: "...",
  },
  onSuccess: function () {
    console.log("onSuccess");
  },
  onFailure: function () {
    console.log("onFailure");
  },
  onCancel: function () {
    console.log("onCancel");
  },
  refreshData: function () {
    var paymentIntention = createPaymentIntention();
    var options = {
      qrString: paymentIntention.qr,
      checkoutId: paymentIntention.id,
      deeplink: {
        url: paymentIntention.deeplink,
        callbackURL: failureUrl,
        callbackURLSuccess: successUrl,
      },
    };
    return options;
  },
  callbackURL: "",
};

GuatapaySDK.GuatapayInitPayment(options);
```
